                    <strong>Do you want to work for a Company?</strong><br>
                    OR<br>
                    <strong>Do you want to work for yourself?</strong><br><br>
 
You sacrifice your health, sleep, family time and best years of your life for a company that doesn’t appreciate you. This doesn’t seem like a winning strategy at all.<br><br>

As per Dr S Ramadorai, adviser to the prime minister in the national council on skill development, Government of India, We are a young economy and we are only growing younger. In 2020, the average Indian will be only 29 years old – compare that with 37 in China and the US, 45 in West Europe and 48 in Japan. 65 per cent of our people will be in the working age group, and this age advantage for India is expected to continue for at least three decades till 2040.<br><br>

ACCORDING to an estimate, we need to create around 1 to 1.5 crore jobs per year for the next decade to provide gainful employment to India’s young population. Large businesses in India, both in the public and private sector, will not be able to generate employment at such a large scale.<br>

There is a need to actively focus on being entrepreneur, which can help in creating sufficient jobs to absorb our large young population.<br><br>

So how do you get started to work for yourself?<br>
