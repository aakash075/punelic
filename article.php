                    <h3>Life Insurance Corporation of India </h3>  
                    Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is an Indian state-owned insurance group and investment company headquartered in Mumbai. It is the largest insurance company in India.The company was founded in 1956 when the Parliament of India passed the Life Insurance of India Act that nationalised the private insurance industry in India. Over 245 insurance companies and provident societies were merged to create the state owned Life Insurance Corporation. 
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>History</h4>
                    The Oriental Life Insurance Company, the first company in India offering life insurance coverage, was established in Calcutta in 1818 by Bipin Behari Dasgupta and others. Its primary target market was the Europeans based in India, and it charged Indians heftier premiums. Surendranath Tagore (son of Satyendranath Tagore) had founded Hindusthan Insurance Society, which later became Life Insurance Corporation.
                    <br><br>
                    The first 150 years were marked mostly by turbulent economic conditions. It witnessed, India's First War of Independence, adverse effects of the World War I and World War II on the economy of India, and in between them the period of world wide economic crises triggered by the Great depression. The first half of the 20th century also saw a heightened struggle for India's independence. The aggregate effect of these events led to a high rate of and liquidation of life insurance companies in India. This had adversely affected the faith of the general public in the utility of obtaining life cover.<br><br>
                    The Parliament of India passed the Life Insurance of India Act on June 19, 1956 creating the Life Insurance Corporation of India, which started operating in September of that year. It consolidated the life insurance business of 245 private life insurers and other entities offering life insurance services, this consisted of 154 life insurance companies, 16 foreign companies and 75 provident companies. The nationalisation of the life insurance business in India was a result of the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, which had created a policy framework for extending state control over at least seventeen sectors of the economy, including life insurance.
